Standing at an original height of 146.6 meters (481 feet), it was the tallest man-made structure in the world for over 3,800 years. The pyramid’s precise construction, using massive stone blocks, remains an engineering marvel even today, sparking awe and intrigue over the methods used to build it.",

According to ancient writers, the gardens were created to please the king’s wife, Amytis, who missed the greenery of her homeland. The gardens were reportedly irrigated by an advanced system using the nearby Euphrates River. However, the existence of the Hanging Gardens remains uncertain, as no definitive archaeological evidence has been found.",
